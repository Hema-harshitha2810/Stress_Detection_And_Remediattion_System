A stress detection system leveraging Haar cascades and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) analyzes facial emotions to identify signs of stress. The Haar cascade classifier efficiently detects facial features in real-time, such as the eyes, mouth, and eyebrows, serving as the initial step in the analysis. Once these features are extracted, a CNN processes the facial expressions to classify emotional states, distinguishing between relaxed and stressed conditions. By training the CNN on a diverse dataset of labeled facial images, the system enhances its accuracy in recognizing subtle changes in emotions. This innovative approach not only provides timely feedback for stress management but also has potential applications in mental health monitoring, workplace productivity, and personalized wellness solutions.
